Hi!

I am Felipe and I'm passionate about mathematics and finance. These are topics which can be a little complicated sometimes, but when you're passionate about something, you can't simply _"let go"_.

Picture the situation: You start by looking into a new topic and then it ignites: _"Oh, that's interesting. I wonder how it really works..."_. When you realise, you have 20 tabs open in your browser, you watched 10 YouTube videos, you have looked at the source code on Github, and now you are on your third tutorial. You finally begin to understand how it all ties together.

There are times however, when the journey is not as pleasant. You keep going from source to source, getting into a rabbit hole that makes you wonder: "How the hell did I get here?"

I have had a fair share of journeys through rabbit holes when trying to understand how some things truly work under the hood. This blog is my attempt to:

1. build the bridge between math and finance
2. demystify how some of topics are used in practice
3. shorten your journey when you are trying to find out what is really going on

I am firm believer that theory is best understood once it is put in practice, so we will be getting our hands dirty (coding, formula derivation, etc) from time to time.

If you found this blog after a similar situation as I described above, I hope you can find some of the answers you seek here.
